## Flask Application Design for a Kids' Newsfeed

### HTML Files

**index.html:**
- This file serves as the homepage of the application.
- It displays a list of news articles with brief summaries and images.

**article.html:**
- This file displays a specific news article in detail.
- It includes the full article text, author, date of publication, and any related images or videos.

**categories.html:**
- This file presents a list of news categories that users can browse.
- It dynamically generates category links based on the available news articles.

### Routes

**@app.route('/'):**
- The root route, which displays the homepage (index.html).

**@app.route('/article/<int:article_id>'):**
- This route displays a specific news article based on its ID. It uses the `article_id` parameter to fetch the article from the database.

**@app.route('/category/<string:category_name>'):**
- This route filters and displays news articles that belong to a specific category. It takes the `category_name` parameter to specify the category.

**@app.route('/search'):**
- This route allows users to search for news articles based on keywords. It uses a search form to collect user input and displays the search results.

### Design Considerations

- The application uses a database to store news articles, categories, and other relevant information.
- The homepage displays a user-friendly interface with easy navigation to different sections of the site.
- The categories page allows users to explore news topics that interest them.
- The search functionality provides a convenient way for users to find specific articles.
- The application enforces user authentication and authorization to ensure the security and integrity of user data.
